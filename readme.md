# GoldMonke Personal Site
This is my personal site :D

It has everything about me anyone would need to know, such as my projects, programming languages I know and am learning, programs I use (e.g. IDEs!), OS's I use. I also wrote a small paragraph about myself.

BTW, on the about me section there is a small easter egg, try finding it :)

If you have any ideas for me to improve the site, please let me know on [Discord](https://discord.com/users/758275913821192202)!
